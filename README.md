## The mathematical and physical concept that is _featured power_

The term _featured power_ was first devised in 2003 and realized in prototypical form 19 April 2004. Since then a series of experimental groups have been prposed and conducted wherein to examine the properties of the Model 'F' oscillator and broadcasting system, described in US Patent [8,274.178](/patent/US8274178.pdf). In a nutshell, the entire experimental apparatus appears thusly:

In the picture the planar coils (bottom right), computation boards (center), remote cards with subtractive coils (left), and extended inductance and capacitiors (far left), as well as the terrestrial capacitor for experiments as well as a calibration equipment and cable-set (top right).

### What is in this repo?

Collection of code used to compute properties of wireless power and other esoteric oscillators. They are correlated by the type of esoterism.

### What is the point of this repo?

To promulgate the patent and find licensees to implement various aspects of the technology. To pursue this aim, what are the most salent features of featured power?

_Fractional_ power transmission

Based on a very early idea (1997), the notion of a single transmitter/receiver in trinary form and sets of coupling coils that fractionalize the power/frequency based on the quotient ratio between the trinary and the minor coil. In the prototypical case, there are a set of five minor coils to a single trinary.

In the picture: Above are the trinary coil and the repeater, two robotic power/data transmission cards, four graduated fractional coils in raw form and one fractional coil mounted on a card for testing and demonstration.

_The Deal_

Offer: The patent covers the ideation but is offered as a part of licensing as an _application extension_.

Realization: In exchange for compensation:

1. Consulting time to devise ideal PoC,
2. Receive an implementation that includes user's documentation, 
3. Collaborative patent to introduce the "spirit of" cooperation going forward,
4. For extra compensation, training of staff and knowledge transfer.

### Multifold Power

The concept of power and data transmission between multiple distant circuits wirelessly and in concert. The current design limited to five.

### Absorbive Skin

A coil-replacement technology where a molecular-injected material performs the same behavior in _multifold mode_ but without ANY wires!

### Past Implementations

* Wireless-power couplings for solar-satellites - ESA. (2012, 2023)
* Medical technology: Neuronal therapy via non-thermal low-frequency waveforms (2011 - 2015)
