## The mathematical and physical concept that is _featured power_

The term _featured power_ was first devised in 2005 subsequent to experiments with the Model 'F' oscillator and broadcasting apparatus:

In the picture the planar coils (bottom right), computation boards (center), remote cards with subtractive coils (left), and extended inductance and capacitiors (far left), as well as the terrestrial capacitor for experiments as well as an analog SWR meter (top right).
