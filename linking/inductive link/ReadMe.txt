COMSOL Litz wire ReadMe

The models trying to determine H between a solid conductor and Litz wire are perhaps irrelevant as, yes, the eddy currents of the changing magnetic field force the field to the skin of the conductor but in examining propagation away from teh conductor, this concern is negible.

Therefore, going forward, the Solid Conductor approximation should be sufficient.

When using more than 5 turns on the secondary, an error is generated on computer about the mesh.

Although I made an error not carrying over the extra turns, evidence seems to suggest the more turns above 3 evenly spaced in the center will yield a greater magnetic flux density between the coils.

It seems that with the size of the primary specified, a secondary of n = 5 and a turn separation of w = 8a allows for a significantly strong beam from Tx to Rx. Yippie! My hypothesis is correct!
